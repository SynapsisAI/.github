# Synapsis AI

> **Complex text to visual clarity.**

## About Us

Synapsis AI is a collaborative project focused on transforming complex text into concise visual summaries through systematic decomposition and reconstruction of core meanings. Our technology decomposes text into fundamental components before synthesizing these elements into structured, visually-enhanced summaries that preserve essential information while significantly reducing complexity.

## Our Team

- **Noah Mialaret**
- **Michelle Nguyen** 
- **Samuel Chau**

## Our Approach

We follow a first-principles approach to text understanding:

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking down documents into paragraphs, sentences, and core meanings
2. **Synthesis**: Reconstructing essential elements into coherent, structured arguments
3. **Visualization**: Enhancing understanding through complementary visual representations

## Projects

### Current Initiatives

#### SynapticCore

Our monorepo containing all project components, libraries, and services that power the Synapsis ecosystem. This unified codebase facilitates seamless integration between our decomposition engine, synthesis algorithms, and visualization tools.
